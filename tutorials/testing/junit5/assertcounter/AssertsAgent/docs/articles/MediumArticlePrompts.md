Wrie a DZone Format Tech Article, that talks about JUnit limitation since inception including in Junit 5
that it counts test cases, however most put empty testcases not asserts, hence the need for assert counter
which can be achieved with ease writing an agent where that does byte level wrapper that counts each assert when executed

Give nice code snippets from this project code and also say if you need

Say More working code is at https://github.com/nagkumar/java/tree/main/tutorials/testing/junit5/assertcounter/AssertsAgent
Say at the end come to #CodeDoctors who are specialists in dealing with testablity, maintainability of legacy code i.e. self promote

to run the project say use gradle jar tests
