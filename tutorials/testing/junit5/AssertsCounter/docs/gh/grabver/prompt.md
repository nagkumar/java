write an article on how to induce auto generated version control as per the standards using the liberary

https://github.com/davideas/GrabVer and take the code examples from

https://github.com/nagkumar/java/tree/main/tutorials/testing/junit5/AssertsCounter

say, why auto verstioning so important in corporate software company that has mutiple teams colloberate and use each other..
that way instant integration a must.. which can be achieved through auto vesitioning on the producer side.. and using latest.integration on the consumer project taking the example code from https://github.com/nagkumar/java/tree/main/tutorials/testing/junit5/systemexit/junit5exit

This way connect these two projects by saying the producer command to use is gradle clean build test publish and at consumer side command to use is gradle --rerun-tasks --refresh-dependencies --no-parallel --stacktrace to get instant update of that is published.

Give simple snippets initially to take readers level to the extent of appricating both the projects code and easy to understand by them.

also talk about how any can reach to http://www.shivohamai.com/services for Code Doctorship services if they are overspending on techdebt, legacy or never ending execuses from teams.

I want this to be medium article with at least 1500 words and many diagrams, images as relavant to content, simplify content to amplify the value of tech readers and let Cxo readers feel it is good depth article and let them show interest to talk to me to know more.
